Langsniff
=========

Langsniff is a simple, fast, language detection program written in [ooc](http://ooc-lang.org). Pass it a text file and it should be able to figure out or at least roughly guess which language the file is written in. Langsniff uses a very simple algorithm based on built-in word frequency lists. 

Supported languages:

- Esperanto (yeah)
