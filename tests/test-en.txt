A centrifuge is a piece of equipment, generally driven by an electric motor 
(some older models were spun by hand), that puts an object in rotation around 
a fixed axis, applying a force perpendicular to the axis. The centrifuge works 
using the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration causes 
more dense substances to separate out along the radial direction (the bottom 
of the tube). By the same token, lighter objects will tend to move to the top 
(of the tube; in the rotating picture, move to the centre). In the picture 
shown, the rotating unit, called the rotor, has fixed holes drilled at an 
angle (to the vertical). Test tubes are placed in these slots and the rotor 
is spun. As the centrifugal force is in the horizontal plane and the tubes 
are fixed at an angle, the particles have to travel only a little distance 
before they hit the wall and drop down to the bottom. These angle rotors are 
very popular in the lab for routine use.
